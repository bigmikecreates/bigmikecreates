# Hi, I’m Michael 👋

I research, experiment, design, build, and operate production systems in high-risk, high-volume environments—primarily across **trading infrastructure**, **automation-first backend platforms**, and **cloud platforms**.

My work primarily focuses on enforcing deterministic control boundaries around stochastic components to build reliable, auditable agentic production systems.

## What I Work On

### 🏗️ Backend & Systems Engineering
- End-to-end ownership of backend systems under production constraints
- Automation-first architectures for configuration, execution, and validation
- Failure-aware system design, incident response, and reliability improvements
- Backend services exposed via REST, WebSockets, GraphQL, and **RPC-style APIs**, RSS feed

### 📈 Trading & Market Infrastructure
- Trading platform Infrastructure
  - MetaTrader 5 (Admin, Manager, Client) 
  - cTrader (Admin, Manager, Client)
  - MatchTrader (Admin, Manager, Client)
- Market data ingestion and reconciliation (OHLCV pipelines)
- Execution quality analysis, latency investigation, and operational risk controls

### Automation, Applied AI & Agentic Systems
- Applied AI used selectively to reduce operational load and cognitive overhead
- RAG pipelines, intent/entity design, and guardrails for production systems
- Hybrid (deterministic + stochastic) workflows for reliability-critical paths
- Neural systems (agentic AI) research and experimentation for prod use cases in comparison to symbolic systems
