# Hi, I’m Michael 👋

I design, build, and operate production systems in high-risk, high-volume environments—primarily across **trading infrastructure**, **market data pipelines**, and **automation-first backend platforms**.

My work focuses on replacing fragile, manual workflows with **reliable, auditable, machine-driven systems**, and owning those systems end-to-end in production.

## What I Work On

### 🏗️ Backend & Systems Engineering
- End-to-end ownership of backend systems under real operational constraints
- Automation-first architectures for configuration, execution, and validation
- Failure-aware system design, incident response, and reliability improvements
- Backend services exposed via REST, WebSockets, and **RPC-style APIs**

### 📈 Trading & Market Infrastructure
- Trading platform infrastructure (MetaTrader 5, cTrader, MatchTrader)
- Market data ingestion and reconciliation (OHLCV pipelines, normalization)
- Execution quality analysis, latency investigation, and operational risk controls

### ⚙️ Automation, Applied AI & Agentic Systems
- Applied AI used selectively to reduce operational load and cognitive overhead
- RAG pipelines, intent/entity design, and guardrails for production systems
- Hybrid deterministic + probabilistic workflows for reliability-critical paths
- Exploration of **agentic AI patterns** as coordination layers within bounded, auditable system architectures

---

## Technical Focus Areas

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript (TypeScript-oriented)
- **Backend & APIs:** REST, WebSockets, RPC-style APIs
- **Data & Storage:** PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Redis
- **Data Pipelines:** Pandas, Polars, PyArrow, ETL design
- **Platforms:** Trading systems, internal tooling, automation frameworks
- **Infra & Tooling:** Docker, Git, CI/CD workflows
- **Applied AI:** RAG, workflow orchestration, production guardrails

## How I Think About Engineering

- Ownership beats abstraction for its own sake  
- Reliability is a feature, not an afterthought  
- Automation should *remove* risk, not introduce new classes of it  
- Agentic systems must remain bounded, observable, and auditable  
- Systems should be boring in production
